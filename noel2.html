						*ring a ding ding*
						Time to take my kids phone
						Not like they need it anyways
						Oh, that was your boyfriend?
						Even more of a reason to take it away
						…
						I should call my husband,
						ask how their day is going
						Hopefully good
						…
						Oh, what is this new app?
						Guess I should check it out
						*one hour later*
						Oh my goodness that is such a cute cat!
						*knock knock*
						Come in!
						My kid asks for his phone
						Told them no, should learn how to moderate their time better

						Make sure the strings are nice and straight
						Prevent the clogs
						Wait, can’t a machine
						Maintain this machine?
						Years later, she saw this idea
						Start to come true
						The factory workers were being replaced with
						These new machines, called robots
						Soon, they will be everywhere.
						You may become one
						If you get the cure
						For intelligence
						Because smarts don’t get
						the rich richer.
