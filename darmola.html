					<li><p>R: there is always something from someone you can always learn.</li></p>
					<li><p>V: doesn’t matter where it’s from, people, books, whatever. Whatever way you can get it. The way see what you are seeing, to get the lesson learned, right, you can just listen to stories and take them at the surface or you can think about it, but it doesn’t even matter because life is life.</li></p>
