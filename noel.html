				<p>Q: Describe how your layered self-portrait visually represents your top three strengths (from the VIA survey). What were your top three strengths?
				How did you choose to visually represent these? How did you make these decisions?</p>
				<p>A: My top three strengths were Fairness, Bravery, and Creativity. I mostly concentrated on Creativity, had a few pictures of bravery, but I couldn’t find any pictures of fairness.</p>
				<p>Q: Describe how your layered self-portrait visually represents the person that you want to be in 2018. What images did you choose to represent your goals? Justify the choices that you made?</p>
				<p>A: I don’t set big, year-long goals, just goals that I try to complete as soon I can. So I guess the poriat describes all of my main goals. My main goals are, learn how to use a sewing machine, learn how to make fursuits, and pass high school (I don’t plan on going to college (no degree in fursuit making)).</p>
				<p>Q: Talk about the composition of your layered self-portrait. How did you resize images to indicate dominance? How did you decide which images would be more dominant?</p>
				<p>A: By how they would blend together.</p>
				<p>Q: Talk about the process of creating your layered self-portrait. What did you learn through the creation of this project deliverable? What did you learn about yourself?</p>
				<p>A: I learned how to use photoshop, and that that could be very useful later on. I also learned that I am somewhat good at organizing when I pay attention.</p>
